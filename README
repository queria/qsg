== Description ==
Long term experiment to creaty "MY OWN" game.

First target is to create simple (realy!) web (html+js in webbrowser) game.
Kind of city building or time-management/clickfest game:
- you should have your own place (city)
- you can build buildings (costs resources/time)
- you gain resources from few buildings
- you can upgrade them

Later maybe add something like trading with other players and so....

For future vision, it should be prepared for realtime Qt/Ogre/... GUI,
addition of single units (heroes) controlled by player and evolution into
mix of city building AND rpg game.
But it's not important (now and for few next years).

So first milestone is "create something/anything what can be played".

== Technical info ==
* You can get this/sources from https://github.com/queria/qsg/
* You need python-2x (Personaly i'm targeting python3 but until better penetration...).
* You can start with examinig/running of src/main.py

== License/Copying ==
Notice:
	Until i will look into this (study possibilities of licenses
	and placing corresponding citations into each files header etc)
	i'm not sure if its legal (valid from law point of view).

Anyway i state that:
